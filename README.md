# island_javarush
Your task is to program an island model with variable parameters, consisting of an array of locations (for example, 100x20 cells). Locations will be filled with vegetation and animals. Animals can:

- eat plants and/or other animals (if their location has suitable food),
- move (to neighboring locations),
- breed (if there is a couple in their location),
- to die of hunger or be eaten.
